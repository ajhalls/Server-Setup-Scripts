# Server-Setup-Scripts

Some of the basic stuff I do to startup a new server preparing it to deal with encoding video, be a web / node server.

The CentOS file shows how I setup bonding the 4 NIC cards on a Dell R610 into a single connection allowing 4Gb. That way when you put it in the datacenter you can start with a single network connection and add more as needed.
